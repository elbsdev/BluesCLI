# BluesCLI
BluesCLI is a text mode only client for BlueSky, the project started as a way to use the network in an jailbroken iPhone 5S, as it uses iOS 12.5 and the official bsky app doesn't support it :(

## Dependencies
[Chitose](https://github.com/mnogu/chitose) - an AT Protocol client library for Python
